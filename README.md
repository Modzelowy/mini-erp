## üöÄ How to Run

This project is designed to be run with Docker. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd mini-erp
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker image for the application and start both the Streamlit app and the PostgreSQL database containers.

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables, which are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can customize the database credentials there if needed.

- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for the database.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The name of the database.
- `POSTGRES_HOST`: The hostname of the database service (should be `db` as defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
